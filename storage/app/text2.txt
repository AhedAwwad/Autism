PECS - Picture Exchange Communication System
The PECS training program originated in the US and was developed by Andy Bondy and Lori Frost in 1985 by the Delaware Autistic Program. It enables people with difficulties in communication or in the absence of communication via picture cards to enter into a communicative exchange with the environment. Children with autism not only have language deficits, they often do not feel the need to communicate with other people.

The aim of PECS is that the child independently initiates communication in order to be able to get in contact with the outside world, as a result of which an improvement in social behavior is to be expected.

The PECS training runs in 6 phases and works with so-called "amplifiers". As an amplifier serve objects, toys, ev. Also foods that the child likes like and that act as a reward to the child. Using amplifiers creates an exchange between child and trainer. In the first phase is to be achieved first that the child at the request of the coach presents a picture card and in return receives the beloved object. Finally, the child learns to form complete sentences with picture cards, to use attributes and new sentence beginnings as well as spontaneous commenting.

The duration of each phase can not be predicted. Experience shows that eye contact improves very quickly and that children adopt the system after a few sessions. The transfer of PECS into everyday life as well as the networking with kindergarten or school are basic prerequisites for the success of the therapy.
