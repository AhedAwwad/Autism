PECS is a unique alternative / complementary communication system, developed by Dr. Ing. Andy Bondy and Lori Frost, MS, CCC-SLP was developed. Initially used in the Delaware Autism Program for preschool children with an autism diagnosis, PECS has since been used successfully worldwide with thousands of learners of all ages and varying cognitive, physical, and communicative limitations.

The PECS teaching protocol is based on B. F. Skinner's book, Verbal Behavior, and a broad range of behavioral analysis. Throughout the protocol, specific help and reinforcement strategies are used that lead to autonomous communication. The protocol also includes systematic error correction procedures to encourage learning when an error occurs. Verbal prompts are not used, creating an immediate initiation by the child and avoiding reliance on model and prompts.

PECS consists of six phases and begins by teaching the student to give a "communication partner" a single picture of a desired object or action, which he immediately acknowledges as a request. The system then teaches the distinction of images and how to put them into sentences. In more advanced stages, participants learn to use attributes, answer questions, and make comments.

The primary goal of PECS is to teach functional communication. Research has shown that some students who use PECS also develop language. Others can switch to a speech computer ("talker"). Research supporting the effectiveness of PECS as an evidence-based practice is extensive and is steadily growing with more than 150 research articles from around the world.
