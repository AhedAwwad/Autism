LEARN PECS WITH PICTURES
Many early childhood autistic individuals not only have serious deficits in the linguistic field but often refuse to communicate with others.

For both problems the therapy procedure PECS was developed (Picture Exchange Communication System).

In the first phase, the therapist supports preferred games of an autistic child only if the child wishes by handing over a card. Already this first step has to be trained often and carefully. But it is enormously important: because it conveys to the child: communication pays off!

In the next steps, the therapist teaches the child to wish as many different actions as possible. There are picture cards that portray this action in concrete terms. When the child hands over the card, it always wields a word that suits it: for example, the word "rocking" when passing a card that depicts a swing.

In fact, after some training, many early childhood autists are able to successfully use a book with up to 30 greeting cards. The aim of the therapy is that the child no longer wishes to play a game by handing over a card, but by naming the right word - so he starts talking to other people!
